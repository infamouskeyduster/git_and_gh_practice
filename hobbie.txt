I have many hobbies, and they define who I am as a person clearly.
I am a lover of the outdoors (and everything you can do outside), nature, and creatures. My hobbies are"
  - hunting
    - I am a firm believer in taking responsibility for your own food source. I procure meat as a hobby,
    and as a way to provide nourishment for my family. Nourishment (meat from game animals) that I know
    has lived a natural life, in a natural setting, and has not been raised by factory farming.
  -flyfishing
    - I am not a flyfishing purist, but I do use a method of fishing known as Tenkara. A tenkara rod is
    telescopic, has a fixed length of line and no reel.
    - I have been pursuing every variety of trout for 20+ years. My favorite trout by far is the Brook Trout.
  - overlanding
    - if you are not familiar with this term, overlanding is a type of off-roading
    where you travel to remote destinations and the journey itself is as important as the destination
    that you are trying to reach.
  - long distance and competitive shooting.
    - for some time now I have been competing competitively with pistols with the organization USPSA.
    - I also enjoy long distance shooting, and all of the mathematics / physics involved in sending a projectile
    1000+ yards and hitting a small target.
    - The furthest shot I have made is 1123 yards (nearly 2/3 of a mile!)
  -reloading
    - for my long distance shooting, I do all of my own ammunition reloading. This is the only way to get
    consistent and repeatable results in distance shooting. You have to take control of every aspect, and
    make sure that it is as perfect as your equipment will allow.
    -I am able to load ammunition that is consistent piece to piece within 1/2 thousandth of an inch.
  - ceramics
    - I have been engaged in making pottery since I was in high school. I make utilitarian pieces that I
    use in my kitchen everyday.
    - My favorite pieces to make are handleless mugs, that are thrown on a pottery wheel, and then the form
    is removed and altered by hand with tool to give it a unique and intimate feel in the hand.
    - I have a small studio set up in my house!
